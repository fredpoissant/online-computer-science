# The Online Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Degree

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science major, According to [McGill College's Computer Engineering curriculum](https://mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-software-engineering)

It is followed by two specializations that would together replace a minor, and thus complete a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
